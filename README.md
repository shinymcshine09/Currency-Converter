# Currency Converter

Converts the given currency to another given currency with an optional amount, in a simple UI. 

## Description

I know that APIs exist that do what this program does better but the purpose of this project was to better understand Python and web scraping.
The conversion rate is taken live from www.marketwatch.com using the python library beautiful soup 4 which scrapes the required data from the website.
I should add that the program does not always work, as the hosts of market watch periodically update their website, although as of 01/12/2023 (UK format) 
the program still works.

* tkinter - https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html
